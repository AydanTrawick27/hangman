# Hangman Game (React)

A simple, interactive Hangman game built with **React**.  
Players can guess letters one at a time, see correct guesses revealed in real time, and watch the hangman graphic progress as incorrect guesses increase. When the maximum number of wrong guesses is reached, the game ends and automatically loads the next word.

---

## Demo

-  Guess letters through a search bar  
-  Correct guesses appear in the letter boxes  
-  Wrong guesses display at the bottom and advance the hangman image  
-  “Game Over” alert when max wrong guesses are reached  
-   New Game button loads the next word

---


---

## How to Play

1. Click in the search bar and enter a **single letter**.  
2. If the letter is in the word, it will appear in its position.  
3. If the letter is not in the word:
   - It will be added to the **Missed Letters** list.
   - The hangman image will update to the next stage.
4. When the hangman reaches the final stage, a **Game Over** alert will appear and the game resets to a new word.
5. You can click **“New Game”** at any time to skip to the next word.
